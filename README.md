# React Native Performance Optimization Lab ðŸš€

A comprehensive React Native application demonstrating various performance optimization techniques and profiling strategies. This project showcases best practices for building high-performance mobile applications using Expo and React Native.

## Features & Optimizations

### Performance Enhancements
- **React Compiler Integration**: Automatic optimization of React components
- **Flashlight Performance Monitoring**: JavaScript FPS measurement and profiling
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Tools and examples for identifying JS memory leaks
- **Optimized List Rendering**: Efficient handling of large data sets
- **Atomic State Management**: Performance-focused state updates
- **Slow Component Detection**: Identification and optimization of rendering bottlenecks

### Profiling Capabilities
- Interactive performance counters
- Real-time FPS monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Component render profiling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- bun
- Expo CLI
- iOS Simulator (for Mac) or Android Emulator

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   bun start
   ```

3. Run on your preferred platform:
   - Press `i` for iOS Simulator
   - Press `a` for Android Emulator
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app for physical device

## Project Structure

The app uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) with the following key directories:

- **app/**: Main application screens and navigation
- **components/**: Reusable React components
- **hooks/**: Custom React hooks for performance optimization
- **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers

## Development Tools

- **Flashlight**: Performance measurement and monitoring
- **React DevTools**: Component profiling and debugging
- **Expo Developer Tools**: Built-in debugging and profiling
